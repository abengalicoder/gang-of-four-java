**Proxy** means ‘in place of’, representing’ or ‘in place of’ or ‘on behalf of’ are literal meanings of proxy and that directly explains Proxy Design Pattern.
Proxies are also called surrogates, handles, and wrappers. 

A real world example can be a cheque or credit card is a proxy for what is in our bank account. It can be used in place of cash, and provides a means of accessing that cash when required. And that’s exactly what the Proxy pattern does – “Controls and manage access to the object they are protecting“.

Proxy pattern is used when we need to create a wrapper to cover the main object’s complexity from the client.

**Some Examples**

A very simple real life scenario is our college internet, which restricts few site access. The proxy first checks the host you are connecting to, if it is not part of restricted site list, then it connects to the real internet. This example is based on Protection proxies.
